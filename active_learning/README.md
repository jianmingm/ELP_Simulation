## Codes for running the GPR/BO pipeline

The codes of the GPR/BO pipeline using the generic string kernel are taken from [Armins's codes](http://xxx)) and based on BoTorch. The two notebooks exploitation.ipynb and exploration.ipynb are used for implementing the pipeline. All the training samples and GPR models are saved in the pickles folder.
